    "Most are aware that Covid-19 has had some sort of impact on the Global Economy. Generally, some believe it has negatively impacted the economy, while others have used it as an opportunity to stimulate economic growth. These classifications may have created a dynamic that is difficult to determine. Leaving most susceptible to misinformation.  Our study aims to discover,\n",

We look towards identifying trends and behaviors under uncertainty to give us an account of how we should proceed with poverty alleviation and economic growth. After doing so, it is the objective of this study to make sense of the data and purposely create a model that will provide a framework to make decisions about the Global Economy.

    "\n",
    "[Global (World) Economy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/global-economy) - The system of industry and trade around the world that has developed as the result of globalization (= the way in which economies have been developing to operate together as one system). It has also become more important and more complex. When one country does well, other countries see a boost in their economies. Some of these industries include, flight, internet, fossil-fuel, banking, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Poverty Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_reduction#:~:text=Poverty%20reduction%2C%20poverty%20relief%2C%20or,lift%20people%20out%20of%20poverty.&text=The%20dawn%20of%20the%20Industrial,now%20considered%20the%20developed%20world.) - is a set of measures, both economic and humanitarian, that are intended to permanently lift people out of poverty. Poverty alleviation involves improving the living conditions of people who are already poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Economic Growth](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-economic-growth-3306014#:~:text=Economic%20growth%20is%20an%20increase,invest%20and%20hire%20more%20employees.) - Economic growth is an increase in the production of goods and services over a specific period. To be most accurate, the measurement must remove the effects of inflation. Economic growth creates more profit for businesses. As a result, stock prices rise. That gives companies capital to invest and hire more employees \n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "* Globalization has led to high economic growth. Therefore, determining whether covid 19 has slowed globalization is relevant to our analysis "
